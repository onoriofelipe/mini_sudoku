The current input is either touchscreen in mobile or mouse in pc version.

The goal is to complete a combination of at least 1 column with NO REPEATED cells, and at least 1 row with NO REPEATED cells. This destroys these cells, triggers rewards and generates random new cells for replacement.

Different mechanics will be added for prototyping. The main idea is to generate mana when completing rows/columns, and use mana for spells that manipulate the board. Secondary mechanics will be added, such as basic items and enemies, with damage dealing, healing, etc, as side-effects of the board manipulation.
